## 💼 LinkedIn Post

**Headline:** I built 12 Web Applications to master Modern Web Development. Here is the code.

**Body:**
Excited to share my latest open-source contribution: **The Ultimate Web Dev Roadmap Portfolio.**

I challenged myself to build 12 unique projects ranging from beginner tools to expert-level platforms, covering the entire spectrum of modern web development.

🚀 **What's inside?**

- **AI & Generative UI:** A prompt-based component generator.
- **Privacy Tech:** A GDPR-compliant analytics dashboard using no cookies.
- **Collaboration Tools:** A real-time rich text editor for resumes.
- **PWA & Offline:** Mobile-first applications that work without internet.

Everything is built with Vanilla JavaScript and modern CSS—no heavy frameworks, just raw performance and understanding of the web platform.

The goal? To provide high-quality, production-ready examples for developers to learn from having "Ashraf Morningstar" quality verification.
